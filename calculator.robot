        Log To Console  defalt multiply two is ${b} (b)
        Log To Console  ----------( b - 1 )-----------
        
        ${c} =  Evaluate  ${b} - 1
        Log To Console  answer is ${c}
        Log To Console  --------------------------

            Exit For Loop
        END  
    END
        Log To Console  The desired answer is ${c}
        #Should Be Equal  ${c}  9
